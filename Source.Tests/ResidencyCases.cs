    /// Background: residency moved out of Core's <c>SynapseCorePawnComp</c> and into Regions and
    /// Territories, which generates the dwellings and was always the only writer. The sandbox suites
    /// cover the rules, but three things are only true in a running game and were unproven until
    /// these cases existed:
    ///
    ///   * ResidencyInjector attaching the comp to real humanlike ThingDefs — it is
    ///     StaticConstructorOnStartup def surgery over DefDatabase, with nothing to assert offline.
    ///   * DwellingStructureGenerator actually marking the occupants it spawns. Dwelling generation
    ///     runs only during map generation, so a -quicktest run that stops at the world map never
    ///     touches the write path at all.
    ///   * The provider round trip. R&amp;T registers Func&lt;Pawn,bool&gt; into
    ///     SynapseCoreProviders.Residency by reflection, with no assembly reference either way. Both
    ///     halves compile and pass in isolation whether or not they ever meet.
